Psychology Simulator

A never-ending project

By Erick Veil

Started in 02-2013

Teaching myself C# by programming "People" who live in a world together, affected by what we know about psychology, and interact with eachother accordingly.

I'd like to lay the basics of psycho-social behavior, in a world with definable parameters, and let the game play itself with the "Player" as observer. As in a zero player game.

Also an exerise in procedural, emergant gameplay.
